# SalesAI
SalesAI is a sales prediction model made using machine learning(XGboost) to predict future sales.

## What inspired us to make SalesAI?
I have noticed that retail shopkeepers have faced loss due to overstocking of product, so I have thought of creating a Sales Prediction Model using Machine Learning to help those retailers

## What are its benefits?
- **Identify Trends** :
  > We have used Rolling Average to identify trends of the past week to determine future sales.
- **No-OverStocking** :
  > It will help to reduce over stocking of product which will help
- **Better Planning** :
  > Would be able to plan much better with this information, and increase profits.
